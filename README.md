### Hey

I'm Noah, a 16 year old programmer who's been at it for about 6 years.

My main two fields are software development and game development.

I mainly program in C, Python, and Java, although I can use most other programming languages just fine if I take the time to get used to them.

I use Ubu- I mean, *Debian* Linux running on a 2015 intel iMac. I use AwesomeWM. 

I am (slowly) working on CanoOS, an operating system, and I like messing around witb low-level technologies.
